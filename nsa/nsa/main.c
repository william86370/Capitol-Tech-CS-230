 *
 * This is a modified version of S/KEY where the password field contains
 * not just 1 OTP key, but 2 OTP keys.  The latter is the new key for the
 * server to store.  When these keys are the same, it operates exactly as
 * S/KEY does.  If they are different, it allows a user to move to a new set
 * of OTPs, since presumably they've run out of the current set.
 *
 * Swapping in a new hash function with different length is easy:
 * The two keys are always the same length, and the password[0] byte indictates
 * the offset to the 2nd OTP key (which is equivalent to the key size).
